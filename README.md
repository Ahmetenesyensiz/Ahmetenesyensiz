### About Me

I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at Bursa Technical University, set to graduate in 2025. I’m passionate about backend development, system design, and building real-world applications that solve real problems.

Currently, I'm interning at WorkRunner where I design and develop workflow processes with real-time data visualization. I’ve also built WhatsApp bots, developed sentiment analysis tools in Python, and actively explore modern tech stacks.

I’m on a journey to become a full-stack developer with a solid backend foundation. Always learning, always building!
